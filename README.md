Every successful hit and kill will build up stacks that increase Ganondorf's armor, up to a maximum of 30 extra armor. Stacks decay after 2 seconds of no build-up. All stacks will be consumed to power up a successful hit of Warlock punch, increasing the damage up to 1000% at the maximum amount of stacks.

### Primary: Punch

## Changelog
- 1.0.3 - Fixes to the following: (I promise this is the last thing I'll update for awhile, I'll get back to making something new)
    - Fixed Ganondorf from not being able to grab those stupid hitscan wisps. Slam those guys into the ground for me will ya.
    - Ganon's character model should be *ｐｒｉｓｔｉｎｅ* and not bugged to hell and back anymore.

- 1.0.2 - Fixes to the following bugs:
    - Changed emission level once again, because I forgot to turn on bloom to test how blinding the light was.
- 1.0.1 - Fixes to the following bugs:
    - Mithrix now spawns instead of just sitting in his cocoon laughing at you for wasting 20 minutes of your run.
    - Ganondorf doesn't get pushed back during Flame Choke now, go grab an entire legion of lemurians!
    - Changed emission level on Ganondorf's mastery skin, hopefully it doesn't blind people now. 
    - Wizard's Foot should now have a lower interrupt priority, so you can try cancelling the kick to do some combos! 
    - Audio across the board has been reduced, sorry for bursting everyone's ears when he does a super powered Warlock Punch.
    - Fixed the Lunar items not being registered for the 8 Lunar Item achievement, hopefully you can get your skin now.
    - Changed the Warlock Punch to only have a random chance to deal a high amount of damage 0.5% of the time.
- 1.0.0 - Initial Release
 
## Future Plans
- Implement new skills
- Fix some bugs (in Known issues)
- Balance the current skills (They may feel a little too strong at the start)  
- Update Ancient Scepter skill for Warlock Punch (it's a little underwhelming)
- Add some hit stop, it's a little anemic right now.
- Add some on-hit VFX, it completely slipped my mind.

## Known Issues
~~literally none, I am a programming god /sarcasm~~

- Animation issues when performing a move before the move finishes, specifically the transition from Aerial Kick to Warlock Punch
- When using Flame Choke from a high spot above the ground, the attack sometimes doesn't register when landing on the ground.
- Flame Choke has some issues when trying to grab a Greater Wisp, it pushes back against Ganondorf, possibly sending him through the floor and out the level for a bit.
