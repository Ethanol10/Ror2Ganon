Every successful hit and kill will build up stacks that increase Ganondorf's armor, up to a maximum of 30 extra armor. Stacks decay after 2 seconds of no build-up. All stacks will be consumed to power up a successful hit of Warlock punch, increasing the damage up to 1000% at the maximum amount of stacks.

### Primary: Punch

## Changelog
- 2.0.0 -> New Features! Hooray! (This will probably be my last update for this mod regarding new content, as I am a terrible animator. However, if someone wants to offer help with animations for more moves, OR I manage to make my own moves in the time it takes to find someone new, I'm down to continue this project. If the mod breaks with new RoR2 Content, I'll try update it so that it won't be deprecated.)
    - 2 New moves! (Unlock them and find out what they are)
    - Another skin! (also with an unlock condition)
    - (slight) VFX updates!
    - Actual hit pauses! (get that weak no-hitpause garbage outta here)
    - Bug Fixes included (as usual)
        - Fixed Ganon not triggering an attack when he lands with Flame Choke. (For later reference, set the position of the blast attack RIGHT BEFORE you trigger the attack.)
        - Fixed Ganon having ridiculously large item displays when in use with other mods (Unless someone decides to use the name positions that I've made.)
        - Fixed Ganon leaving Greater Wisp Corpses lying all over the place. Gotta make the place clean while destroying everything.
- 1.0.3 - Fixes to the following: (I promise this is the last thing I'll update for awhile, I'll get back to making something new)
    - Fixed Ganondorf from not being able to grab those stupid hitscan wisps. Slam those guys into the ground for me will ya.
    - Ganon's character model should be *ｐｒｉｓｔｉｎｅ* and not bugged to hell and back anymore.
    - e.g Old:

- 1.0.2 - Fixes to the following bugs:
    - Changed emission level once again, because I forgot to turn on bloom to test how blinding the light was.
- 1.0.1 - Fixes to the following bugs:
    - Mithrix now spawns instead of just sitting in his cocoon laughing at you for wasting 20 minutes of your run.
    - Ganondorf doesn't get pushed back during Flame Choke now, go grab an entire legion of lemurians!
    - Changed emission level on Ganondorf's mastery skin, hopefully it doesn't blind people now. 
    - Wizard's Foot should now have a lower interrupt priority, so you can try cancelling the kick to do some combos! 
    - Audio across the board has been reduced, sorry for bursting everyone's ears when he does a super powered Warlock Punch.
    - Fixed the Lunar items not being registered for the 8 Lunar Item achievement, hopefully you can get your skin now.
    - Changed the Warlock Punch to only have a random chance to deal a high amount of damage 0.5% of the time.
- 1.0.0 - Initial Release
 
## Future Plans
- Implement new skills
- Fix some bugs (in Known issues)
- Balance the current skills (They may feel a little too strong at the start)  
- Update Ancient Scepter skill for Warlock Punch (it's a little underwhelming)
- Add some hit stop, it's a little anemic right now.
- Add some on-hit VFX, it completely slipped my mind.

## Known Issues
~~literally none, I am a programming god /sarcasm~~

- Animation issues when performing a move before the move finishes, specifically the transition from Aerial Kick to Warlock Punch
- Flame Choke has some issues when trying to grab a Wandering Vagrant, Greater Wisp, Solus Control Unit (this isn't an exhaustive list), it pushes back against Ganondorf, possibly sending him through the floor and out the level for a bit.
- Special move #2 *very rarely* doesn't register that it hit the floor and as a result, leaves you stuck in the air for a bit. I've only ever encountered this once, so if you do encounter it again, please tell me exactly how you replicated it.
