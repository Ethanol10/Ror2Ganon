## Changelog
- 1.0.0 - Initial Release

  

## Future Plans
- Implement new skills
- Fix some bugs (in Known issues)
- Balance the current skills (They may feel a little too strong at the start)  
- Update Ancient Scepter skill for Warlock Punch (it's a little underwhelming)

## Known Issues
~~literally none, I am a programming god /sarcasm~~

- Animation issues when performing a move before the move finishes, specifically the transition from Aerial Kick to any other move.
- When using Flame Choke from a high spot above the ground, the attack sometimes doesn't register when landing on the ground.
- The model is broken, from the conversion from multiple materials to a single material.

 
## Credits
